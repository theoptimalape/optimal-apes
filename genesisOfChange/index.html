          Change, it is literally intertwined within the laws of reality. It
          occurs in the form of seasons, and the passing of time. It is seen in
          the greying of hair, and the aging of skin. We see it in food when it
          spoils, and new growth sprouted from soil. It is the pendulum swinging
          between decay and rebirth. An immense natural law that predicates the
          very rhythm of our lives. And yet, we have come to wield a sliver of
          its power.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          No, we can't change the seasons, or prevent food from ultimately
          succumbing to its rotten fate. We can't prevent aging, or stave off
          death. The circumstances of change are concrete and undebatable. Our
          responses to these curcumstances, however, are susceptible to our
          will. We are capable of actively and intentionally taking part in the
          creation of the world we live in. We can change into someone who is a
          helpful, and meaningful member of the human tribe.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This metaphysical concept that trasmutes the division between idea and
          reality can be a gift, if utilized with intention. We are always
          changing, it is an inevitability. What is not inevitable is the
          outcome, and progress gained during the time we are alive. It is
          completely possibly to set forth with noble aim, and hit your mark. It
          is possible to speak the champion within you into existence. Much like
          the autumn leaves, or summer breeze, you too can bring into existence
          a moment of benevolence, and a resource for good.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Wether it be a professional pursuit, an adoption of healthy habits,
          the removal of bad habits, the resolution of conflict, or anything in
          between, the capability for change exists within you. At times perhaps
          goals seem monumental, and unachievable. More often than not, this is
          the result of the imagination setting forth counterarguments, and
          voicing concerns that add to the bounty of doubt. But if we were to
          ignore doubt, asses our position in life, look at that in relation to
          our goal, and begin reverse engineering a method to get there, it
          suddenly becomes possible. Add some will power and action to that
          recipe, and it becomes reality.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In regards to the human will, it is hard to estimate what the limit of
          human potential is. With the recent discoveries in science, we find
          that the brain is in fact a more potent tool than we previously
          imagined. Like the monks of Shaolin, or the artic ice swimmer Wim Hof,
          or the master of physical feats David Blaine, we find that human
          beings are fitted with the potential for amazing feats. They all start
          in the mind, and are fueled by the passion and desire of the human
          spirit.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          This quality of change, and desire to take action lives in me. It is a
          constant nudge or pull in the direction of responsibility. It is the
          nagging voice of reason when I step out of line, and the vivid dreamer
          that encourages me to continue forth on my mission. What gnaws away at
          your soul? What does the fire that spurs up motivation and flushes you
          with purpose look like? If you focus on that and imagine a reality
          where you refine that passion, what do you look like then? What are
          some changes you would like to make in your life?
