          Fitness influencers and celebrity health advocates are found by the
          shit ton today. Health and wellness have become a topic of great
          interest. Not only is there a physical benefit to aesthetics and
          mobility, but it also provides and economic opportunity. Today we dive
          deeper into the territory of the abstract, and deeply impactful
          benefits that also come along with physical training.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          One of the greatest minds to ever explore this crossroads between
          fitness and philosophy was none other that Bruce Lee. He was well
          aware of a mind, body connection occuring in us all. Much like a
          muscle, it is something that can be trained and refined, bringing
          forth a range of physiological benefits.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="quote margin-b">
          "By adopting a certain physical posture, a resonant chord is struck in
          spirit."
          <br />
          - Bruce Lee
        </blockquote>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The quote above from Lee depicts that connection. Conditioning the
          body to become strong, resilient, and capable, will simultaneously
          condition the spirit to do the same. It is not the knowing, or hearing
          of wisdom that makes us grow, but the doing, and living by its
          principles. Sometimes it is unappealing to get out of bed, and get the
          day going. We may fee like we need some ispiration, but as in this
          example, it is the getting out of bed and getting going that are
          inspiring.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Taking on our responsibilities and challenges head on, allthough
          intimidating, are the most rewarding decisions we can make. Our
          situations dramatically improve as a result of effort, and that alone
          can be inspirational. But no matter the amount of information or
          knowledge we have, action must take place before reward.
